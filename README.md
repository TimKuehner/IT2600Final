### What is a Motherboard?
>A motherboard is one of the most essential parts of a computer system. It holds together many of the crucial components of a computer, including the central processing unit (CPU), memory and connectors for input and output devices. The base of a motherboard consists of a very firm sheet of non-conductive material, typically some sort of rigid plastic. Thin layers of copper or aluminum foil, referred to as traces, are printed onto this sheet. These traces are very narrow and form the circuits between the various components. In addition to circuits, a motherboard contains a number of sockets and slots to connect the other components.                                    Reference: Study.com

A Motherboard acts as a central hub of sorts.  It's main purpose is to manage all of the other subsystems within the computer. It controls communication throughout the system and it also distributes power to various other systems.

<Processor Socket="Processor Socket">
### Processor Socket
</a>

The purpose of the Processor Socket or "CPU socket" is to create a connection between the Motherboard and microprocessor.  It allows for easy swapping of CPU without having to do any soldering(depending on your system).

---

<Memory Slots="Memory Slots">
### Memory Slots
</a>

The memory slots are what allows RAM into be inserted into the system and determines the type of RAM that can be used.  A typical Motherboard has anywhere from 2-4 slots, but a high end Motherboard can have up to 8.

---

<Video Card Slot="Video Card Slot">
### Video Card Slot
</a>

This slots purpose is for putting the video card into the system.  Many older systems don't have this slot and you are forced to use the card that is integrated into the board.  Older models tend to use AGP(Accelerated Graphics Port) as the format of the slot but newer higher-end models tend to use PCI-Express ports which is able to take advantage of greater amounts of bandwidth and can lower the cost of the Motherboard overall.

---

<Expansion Slots="Expansion Slots">
### Expansion Slots
</a>

The purpose of expansion slots are to allow you to further the practicality and functionality of your system by allowing you to add additional components into your system.  This commonly comes in the form of PCI/PCIe slots.  Some of the components that can be added to the expansion slots are:
* Network Interface cards
* Sound cards
* Additional graphics cards
* Ethernet
* Expanded memory
* Etc.

---

<IDE/SATA Ports="IDE/SATA Ports">
### IDA/SATA Ports
</a>

The purpose of these ports is to create connectivity between the Motherboard and the storage devices and optical drives.  IDE's are mostly used in older models and being steadily replaced by SATA's which are smaller, more efficient, and more practical.  

---

<BIOS Chip="BIOS Chip">
### BIOS Chip
</a>

This component is one of the most simple in the system.  The chip contains the code that is needed to boot up the computer.  Unlike other components though it does require a battery as the chip requires power to be moving through it at all times.

---

<Northbridge/Southbridge="Northbridge/Southbridge">
### Northbridge/Southbridge
</a>

Northbridge
* The purpose of the Northbridge is to manage the data flow between the memory, the video card, and the processing unit.

Southbridge
* This has the same purpose as the Northbridge expcept that the components that it manages are the peripherals such as various cards(sound, video, network, etc) in addition to assisting in the management of the processing unit.

<Front Panel Connectors="Front Panel Connectors">
### Front Panel Connectors
</a>

 This is where the connection to everything in the front of the system happens.  components such as the power button and USB connectors.

 ---

<Rear Connectors="#rear connectors">
### Rear Connectors
</a>

This serves the same purpose as the Front Panel Connectors except that it is for the connections that happen at the "rear" of the unit, connections such as the mouse, keybord, and/or speakers.
